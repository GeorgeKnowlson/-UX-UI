<b>The desgins of UX VS UI.</b>
<i>Our goal is to look at the differences between these two areas.</i>
<u>UX is for "the UX is absolutely seamless and users prefers!And to the entire interaction you have with a product, including how you feel about the interaction.<u>
<u>while UI refers to the screens, buttons, toggles, icons, and other visual elements that you interact with when using a website, app, or other electronic device.</u>
